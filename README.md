# 📘 Open-Source vs Closed-Source Repositories

## ✅ Open-Source Repository

An **open-source repository** contains code that is publicly available and licensed for others to use, modify, and distribute.

### 🔹 Key Characteristics

* Code is publicly visible
* Includes a LICENSE file defining usage rights
* Community contributions are allowed
* Encourages collaboration and transparency

### 🔹 Examples

* Google **Kubernetes** → Apache 2.0 license, community-driven
* Netflix **Hystrix** → Open-source project used by many developers

👉 Users can view, fork, modify, and reuse code according to license terms.

## 🔒 Closed-Source Repository

A **closed-source repository** contains proprietary code that is not available for public reuse or modification.

### 🔹 Key Characteristics

* Code access is restricted
* No permission to reuse or modify
* Typically used for commercial or internal products
* May be private or sometimes public without reuse rights

👉 Only authorized users can access or work with the code.
